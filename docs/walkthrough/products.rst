Managing the Catalogue
======================

Creating the Product Index
--------------------------
Wagtails' ``Page`` models are organized in a tree structure. All our ``Product`` pages will therefore
need a parent. This is provided by the  ``ProductIndex`` model. 

.. note::
  Read more about Wagtail pages in the `Wagtail docs <http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.9/topics/pages.html>`_

To add a product index page:

- Navigate to the admin and log in
- Select the homepage from the explorer menu
- Select ``add child page``
- Select ``Product index`` and enter the title (e.g. `Products`)

  .. figure:: ../_static/images/product_index.png

We can now add ``Product`` models as children of ``ProductIndex``. Only pages of type ``Product`` can be created under ``ProductIndex``.

Adding a Product
----------------

Under the explorer homepage, we should now see our newly created ``ProductIndex``. We can select ``Add child page`` to add our first 
``Product``. The ``Product`` model is fairly minimal. It has:

- A title
- A description
- One or more ``ProductVariant``s
- Optionally some images and tags

  .. figure:: ../_static/images/product.png


Customising Variants
--------------------

The ``ProductVariant`` model is where we can customise the attributes of our model. Running ``longclaw start``
provided a ``products`` with a minimal implementation of a custom ``ProductVariant`` model. 
We can further customise this now by opening ``my_shop/products/models.py`` in a text editor.

``ProductVariant`` inherits from ``ProductVariantBase`` which provides the ``price``, ``ref`` and ``slug`` fields. 

The ``ref`` field is intended to be used as a short description or sub-title to help distinguish a particular variant.
The ``slug`` field is autogenerated from the ``ref`` and the parent ``Product`` title.

As we are creating a T-shirt shop, we are going to add a ``size`` field to the model. We will also
remove the ``description`` field as we dont have any real need for it at the moment:

.. code:: python

  class ProductVariant(ProductVariantBase):
      _SIZE_CHOICES = (
        ('S', 'S'),
        ('M', 'M'),
        ('L', 'L'),
        ('XL', 'XL'),
        ('XXL', 'XXL')
      )

      size = models.CharField(max_length=3, choices=_SIZE_CHOICES) 

After making and running migrations, we can now select the size for each variant:

  .. figure:: ../_static/images/product_variant.png

The actual model used for the product variant can be changed by changing the ``PRODUCT_VARIANT_MODEL`` setting in your ``settings.py``

Creating the Front End
=======================

Since ``ProductIndex`` and ``Product`` are Wagtail pages, we write templates for them just like any other page.
The Wagtail documentation already comprehensively covers `writing templates <http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.9/topics/writing_templates.html>`_.

Our template project already has some basic templates for ``ProductIndex`` and ``Product``:

- ``my_shop/my_shop/templates/longclawproducts/product_index.html``
- ``my_shop/my_shop/templates/longclawproducts/product.html``

They contain just enough information to demonstrate how to traverse the products and their fields.
For a more complete template, take a look at the `demo project <https://github.com/JamesRamm/longclaw_demo>`_.

Adding Products to the Basket
-----------------------------

An important detail of the product template is providing the ability to add or remove a product to the basket. 
This is done by making AJAX calls to the longclaw API.

In the product template, we will provide an 'Add' button and a 'Remove' button for each ``ProductVariant``.
Here is a django template snippet to achieve that:

.. code-block: django

    {% for variant in page.variants.all %}
    <div>
      <!-- Info etc. about the product variant goes here.... -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <button class="btn btn-primary" id="add-button" data-variant-id="{{variant.id}}">Add</button>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-2">
        <button class="btn btn-primary" data-variant-id="{{variant.id}}">Remove</button>
    </div>

    {% endfor %}


We can then write a jquery function to handle the click events:
