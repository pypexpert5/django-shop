Managing the Catalogue
======================

Creating the Product Index
--------------------------
Wagtails' ``Page`` models are organized in a tree structure. All our ``Product`` pages will therefore
need a parent. This is the `product index`. 

.. note::
  Read more about Wagtail pages in the `Wagtail docs <http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.9/topics/pages.html>`_

Add a product index by:

- Navigate to the admin
- Select the homepage from the explorer menu
- Select ``add child page``
- Select ``Product index``

  .. figure:: ../_static/images/product_index.png


We can now add ``Product``'s to the product index. Only pages of type ``Product`` can be created under ``ProductIndex``.
